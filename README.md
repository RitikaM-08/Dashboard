# Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company understand their employees data. It helps them to know how many hours the employees are working, what is their login and logout times. It also categorises data based on different usernames and roles.

# Steps followed
- Step 1 : Numbered the rows, starting at 1 and going up in 1s.
- Step 2 : Used conditional column to add a column 'Role' to make Mia Wilson and Mila Murphy as the supervisors while the others as the Data Analysts.
- Step 3 : Then divided the log in times into Morning (6 a.m.-12 noon), Afternoon (12 noon-6 p.m.), Evening (6-10 p.m.) and late Evening/early Morning (10 p.m.-6 a.m.).
- Step 4 : Close and apply.
- Step 5 : Two different visualizations were added, namely, column chart and slicers.
- Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for three fields named "Role", "Username", and "duration of login".
- Step 7 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the login duration by different roles.

A slicer was added to demonstrate the "Role".
